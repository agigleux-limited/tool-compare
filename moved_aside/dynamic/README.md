# Dynamic Analysis Test Cases

These test cases focus on showcasing a tool's dynamic analysis capabilities. Specifically, this means looking at
the live cloud environment and deriving issues pertaining to resources described in IaC. For example,
if a resource in IaC is impacted by another resource already existing in the live cloud environment,
or if a resource can be determined to be problematic based on data in the live cloud environment.
